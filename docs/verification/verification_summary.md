# Verification Summary

**Date:** 2026-05-11  
**Scope:** PlatformManifest, the private-manifest repo, managed private project, Custodian, OperationsCenter, CxRP, RxP  
**Overall status:** `PASS`

The ontology and visibility expansion is now complete across model, data, and
consumer boundaries.

The remaining gaps from the earlier remediation cycle are closed:

- The private-manifest repo now exists as a dedicated repository for private topology data.
- managed private project private topology now lives in the private-manifest repo, not as a repo-local
  private-topology special case.
- Platform/public, private, project, work-scope, and local manifest shapes are now
  explicit and layered.
- First-class ontology relationships fail closed and are enforced by Custodian PMV.
- OperationsCenter consumes the private layer as metadata and keeps canonical
  cross-repo contract ownership in CxRP.

## Summary by phase

| Phase | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 — Documentation foundation | `PASS` | Repository roles, ownership boundaries, and diagrams are explicit and consistent. |
| Phase 2 — Vocabulary audit | `PASS` | PlatformManifest, CxRP, and RxP ownership remains clearly separated. |
| Phase 3 — Manifest model updates | `PASS` | Private manifests, ontology relationships, and explicit projection metadata are model-visible and schema-visible. |
| Phase 4 — Projection tests | `PASS` | Projection remains deterministic, fail-closed, and validation-backed. |
| Phase 5 — Custodian integration | `PASS` | PMV detector ownership remains in PlatformManifest and enforcement covers first-class relationships. |
| Phase 6 — OperationsCenter consumption notes | `PASS` | OC consumes platform/private/project/work-scope/local layers without claiming ontology ownership. |
| Remediation A — Manifest shape taxonomy | `PASS` | Platform/public, private, project, work-scope, and local shapes are explicit and distinct. |
| Remediation B — General private manifest | `PASS` | The private manifest is first-class in PlatformManifest and now has a dedicated data repo. |
| Remediation C — First-class relationship vocabulary | `PASS` | Ontology relationships are model-visible, schema-visible, queryable, and PMV-enforced. |
| Remediation D — Explicit projection metadata | `PASS` | Entity and relationship projection metadata are explicit and fail closed. |
| Remediation E — Projection validation hardening | `PASS` | `project-public` validates before final output is written; unsafe generation is isolated. |

## End-State Evidence

### `PASS` — dedicated private topology repo exists

Evidence:
- [private-manifest repo README](<private-manifest-repo>/README.md)
- [managed private project private manifest](<private-manifest-repo>/manifests/managed-private-project/private_manifest.yaml)
- [private-manifest repo validation workflow](<private-manifest-repo>/.github/workflows/validate.yml)

The private-manifest repo is now a separate repository that owns private topology data
files. PlatformManifest still owns the private-manifest shape, schema, loader,
composition, and visibility semantics.

### `PASS` — managed private project moved under the private-manifest layer

Evidence:
- [managed private project private manifest](<private-manifest-repo>/manifests/managed-private-project/private_manifest.yaml)
- [managed private project project manifest shim](../../../../managed private project/topology/project_manifest.yaml)
- [managed private project local manifest example](../../../../managed private project/topology/local_manifest.example.yaml)

managed private project is now represented as one managed private project within the
private-manifest layer. Its repo-local project manifest is only a compatibility
shell and no longer carries private topology truth.

### `PASS` — manifest shapes are locked down

Evidence:
- [manifest_system.md](./manifest_system.md)
- [public_private_projection.md](../architecture/public_private_projection.md)
- [platformmanifest_ontology.md](../architecture/platformmanifest_ontology.md)

The system now distinguishes:

- Platform/Public Manifest — safe public projection
- Private Manifest — private platform superset
- Project Manifest — project-scoped extension slice
- Work-Scope Manifest — task/work overlay
- Local Manifest — machine/user/runtime overlay

### `PASS` — OperationsCenter consumes the private layer cleanly

Evidence:
- [settings.py](../../../OperationsCenter/src/operations_center/config/settings.py)
- [repo_graph_factory.py](../../../OperationsCenter/src/operations_center/repo_graph_factory.py)
- [graph_doctor main](../../../OperationsCenter/src/operations_center/entrypoints/graph_doctor/main.py)
- [test_repo_graph_factory_from_settings.py](../../../OperationsCenter/tests/unit/test_repo_graph_factory_from_settings.py)

OperationsCenter now supports `platform -> private -> (project xor work_scope)
-> local` composition, including explicit `private_manifest_path` and
conventional discovery through the private-manifest repo. It remains a consumer
of PlatformManifest-owned semantics.

### `PASS` — canonical wire ownership remains in CxRP

Evidence:
- [OperationsCenter contract map](../../../OperationsCenter/docs/architecture/contracts/contract-map.md)
- [OperationsCenter contract ownership tests](../../../OperationsCenter/tests/unit/contracts/test_contract_ownership.py)

CxRP owns canonical cross-repo proposal, routing, and execution semantics.
OperationsCenter keeps stricter internal `OcPlanningProposal`,
`OcRoutingDecision`, `OcExecutionRequest`, and `OcExecutionResult` models with
explicit boundary mapping and explicit boundary mapping only.

## Final result

The PlatformManifest ontology and visibility expansion is complete:

- ontology ownership is explicit
- protocol ownership remains separated
- public/private/local boundaries are enforced
- private topology lives in a dedicated private data repo
- managed private project remains separately managed
- OperationsCenter remains a consumer of validated manifest metadata
- Custodian remains a generic enforcement runtime that loads PlatformManifest policy

No top-level verification `WARN` remains for this slice.
